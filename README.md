Coursework powered by C#

Technical tasks to the course work on the discipline "Programming languages".

The theme of the Development is to create the simulation program of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks 	

The General formulation of the task:
It is necessary to develop a program to simulate the operation of the peer-to-peer network, as well as to visualize the process of data transfer, showing computers in the network that have parts of files or entire parts of files using the C# programming language.

Graphical and user interface requirements:

• the program should work in graphical mode;

• network mode selection (distributed computing/torrent tracker) must be present);

• should be implemented the animation data transmission;

• the program must use visual controls (graphic menu, buttons);

• there must be a choice of the number of peers in the network.

Functional requirements:

• data transfer animation algorithms must be implemented;

• the user interface should be as friendly and clear as possible;

• you must be able to change the number of peers in the network;
